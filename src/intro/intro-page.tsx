                <p className="mb-4">Ever since I was a kid, I've always been fascinated with computers. I started coding at 16 when my high school offered an introduction to programming course. Writing those early java programs, I loved the feeling of creating something from just the thoughts and ideas in my head. I was hooked and I knew I wanted to write code for a living. I went to college for computer science and never looked back.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">Currently, I live and work in the greater Philadelphia area.</p>
